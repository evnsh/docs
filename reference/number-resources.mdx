We take pride in owning and managing our own Number Resources. This includes our Autonomous System Number (ASN), IPv4, and IPv6 addresses. Our commitment to autonomy empowers us to maintain superior network control, ensure enhanced stability, and customize our services to align with evolving industry standards. This dedication results in providing our clients with a robust and reliable infrastructure.

## Autonomous System Number (ASN)
- **ASN:** AS44658

## IPv4 Addresses
We manage the following IPv4 address ranges:

- **23.169.88.0/24**
- **83.147.216.0/24**

## IPv6 Addresses
Our IPv6 address range is:

- **2602:f9a6::/36**

<Tip>A text list of our IPv4 and IPv6 addresses is available at https://as44658.net/ips.txt</Tip>

## Reverse DNS Servers
Our Reverse DNS (rDNS) services are essential for translating IP addresses into domain names. This adds an extra layer of functionality and security to our network infrastructure.

### DNS Server Information:
Primary DNS Server: `ns1.as44658.net` \
Secondary DNS Server: `ns2.as44658.net`

### Reverse DNS PTR Record Format:
For IPv4 addresses, our reverse DNS follows the format `v4.as44658.net`, and for IPv6 addresses, the format is `v6.as44658.net`. This structured approach ensures clarity and consistency in reverse DNS records across our network.

Example: \
IPv4 rDNS Record: `23.169.88.1` translates to `1.88.169.23.v4.as44658.net` \
IPv6 rDNS Record: `2602:f9a6::` translates to `0.6.a.9.f.2.6.0.v6.as44658.net`

## Announcements and Regions
Our BGP announcements across various regions are fortified with secure practices, including Internet Routing Registry (IRR), Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), and Route Origin Authorization (ROA). We actively validate RPKI information to enhance the overall security of our network.

We announce these ranges from our various regions. For more details on our regions, please refer to our [Regions](/regions) page.
